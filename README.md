# Hand-Written-digit-Recognition
Classify hand written digit on a gray scale image

# Files:
- Digit Recognition with gradient descent
- NN_digit_recognition
uses Neural Network to train the model
- Regularized digit recognition
uses regularization in gradient descent
- HandWritten digit recongtion in TENSORFLOW

- data
10,0000 different gray scale images of handwritten digits, in csv
- label
its corresponding labels
- label_mx10
is 1X10 one hot representation of labels

- test_350 have 350 examples in a set - used in TENSORFLOW model and NN model
- test_1000 have 1000 examples in a set- used in other two
